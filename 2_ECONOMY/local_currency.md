# Urban Alchemy Local Currency  
*Optional tokens for supporting localized exchange and cooperation*

---

## Preamble

The Local Currency is a **voluntary, community-driven medium** designed to facilitate **reciprocal exchange and resource circulation** within and between Patches.  
It exists **to enhance cooperation, not to replace the commons or create hierarchy**.  
Participation is **entirely optional**, and Patches may choose whether and how to adopt it.

---

## I. Principles

1. **Voluntary Use** — no one is required to hold or transact currency to participate in the commons.  
2. **Supplementary** — serves as a tool to enhance transparency and track contributions alongside the Rewards Engine and Reciprocity Ledger.  
3. **Autonomy** — Patches may issue, regulate, or retire tokens at their discretion.  
4. **Non-Extractive** — currency is not intended to generate profit or enforce obligation.  
5. **Regenerative Circulation** — tokens encourage sharing, collaboration, and sustainability rather than hoarding.

---

## II. Currency Forms

Local Currency may take multiple forms depending on Patch preference:

- **Digital Tokens** — blockchain-style or ledger-based units for record-keeping and transparency.  
- **Physical Tokens** — coins, cards, or symbolic objects representing value.  
- **Cultural or Experiential Tokens** — acknowledgments, privileges, or participation points within rituals or community projects.  

---

## III. Issuance and Management

- Each Patch may **issue its own tokens**, creating unique rules for creation, transfer, and retirement.  
- Tokens can be **earned through contributions**, voluntary participation, or cultural engagement.  
- Transfers are **voluntary and consensual**, respecting both giver and recipient.  
- Patches may link their tokens with other Patches to encourage cross-community exchange.

---

## IV. Integration with the Commons

- Tokens serve as a **layer of visibility**, tracking contribution flows without limiting access to shared resources.  
- They may complement the **Rewards Engine** and **Reciprocity Ledger** by quantifying engagement.  
- Participation is **opt-in**, preserving Patch autonomy and reinforcing ethical, regenerative exchange.

---

## V. Autonomy and Optional Participation

- Patches may choose:  
  - To adopt or ignore the local currency entirely.  
  - To create cross-Patch exchange systems or remain insular.  
  - To adjust token rules, issuance, or retirement at any time.  
- No Patch or individual is **required** to participate in local currency for recognition, access, or membership in the network.

---

## VI. Closing Statement

Local Currency is a **supportive tool, not a mandate**:  

> *“Tokens are echoes of generosity, visible markers of the flows that sustain the commons — never a chain, always a mirror.”*  

It reinforces connection, clarity, and collaboration while **honoring the autonomy and self-determination** of every Patch and participant.
