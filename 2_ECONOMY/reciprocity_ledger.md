# Urban Alchemy Reciprocity Ledger  
*Mapping the flow of value and care in autonomous and networked communities*

---

## Preamble

The Reciprocity Ledger is a **living map of interdependence**.  
It records flows of contribution, exchange, and support across Patches and individuals, highlighting both visible and invisible work.  

The ledger is **relational, not transactional**: its purpose is to cultivate awareness, strengthen bonds, and foster regenerative practices rather than enforce obligations.

## I. Principles

1. **Visibility without Coercion** — flows are documented to inform and inspire, not to mandate repayment.  
2. **Reciprocity over Accounting** — entries emphasize mutuality, care, and relational enrichment.  
3. **Autonomy** — Patches and participants choose their level of participation and what to share.  
4. **Inclusivity** — all types of contributions, including intangible or cultural labor, are valid.  
5. **Iterative Growth** — the ledger evolves as relationships, needs, and practices evolve.

## II. Scope of the Ledger

The ledger tracks:

- **Material Contributions** — tools, seeds, building materials, or other tangible assets shared.  
- **Labor & Facilitation** — work, teaching, mentoring, or organizing events.  
- **Cultural Contributions** — rituals, apprenticeships, storytelling, or creative production.  
- **Support & Care** — mediation, emotional support, or assistance in governance and stewardship.  

> Each entry represents a **flow of value**, documenting who gave, who received, and the impact on the commons.

## III. Ledger Structure

Each ledger entry may include:

1. **Contributor(s)** — individual(s) or Patch(es) providing value.  
2. **Recipient(s)** — individual(s), Patch(es), or network entity receiving the contribution.  
3. **Type of Contribution** — material, labor, cultural, or relational.  
4. **Impact / Notes** — qualitative or quantitative description of effect on the commons.  
5. **Optional Acknowledgment** — peers may add recognition, reflections, or gratitude.

Ledgers may exist at **Patch-level**, **network-level**, or both, depending on the autonomy and preference of participants.

---

## IV. Practices for Using the Ledger

1. **Voluntary Logging** — participation is optional, respecting autonomy.  
2. **Periodic Reflection** — Patches and individuals review flows to understand relationships, capacity, and impact.  
3. **Celebration of Contribution** — highlight meaningful exchanges in rituals, reports, or local gatherings.  
4. **Informing Rewards** — ledger entries may feed into the Rewards Engine if participants opt in.  
5. **Transparency with Boundaries** — sensitive contributions may remain private while still acknowledged in aggregate.  

---

## V. Autonomy and Network Integration

- Patches may **operate independent ledgers**, optionally connecting them with other Patches for broader visibility.  
- Ledger participation does **not impose obligations**; it serves as a **mirror of relational health and reciprocity**.  
- Cross-Patch flows are **encouraged but not required**, strengthening cohesion without eroding autonomy.

## VI. Closing Statement

The Reciprocity Ledger is a **living reflection of interdependence**, capturing the subtle currents of contribution and care that sustain Urban Alchemy:  

> *“Value is not only what is given or received, but what flows between us, alive in the relationships we cultivate.”*
