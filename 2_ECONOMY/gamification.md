# Gamification — Economy  
*Play as the circulatory system of the commons.*

---

## I. Overview

Urban Alchemy treats economy not as a system of scarcity, but as a **field of creative exchange**.  
Gamification here transforms contribution into a **playful form of reciprocity**, where labor, art, and service weave the living fabric of value.

> “The game is to give — and to give beautifully.”

## II. Principles of a Playful Economy

1. **Reciprocity over Transaction** — every act of creation enriches the field, not just the actor.  
2. **Recognition as Currency** — gratitude, trust, and reputation become tangible measures of contribution.  
3. **Circular Value Flow** — what one gives returns transformed through the actions of others.  
4. **Transparency & Consent** — all exchanges are visible, voluntary, and modifiable.  
5. **Joy as Yield** — the health of the economy is measured by vitality, not accumulation.

## III. Economic Game Components

### 1. Contribution Quests
- **Daily & Seasonal Challenges** for repairing, creating, or teaching.  
- Completion yields **Reciprocity Points (RP)** — non-monetary tokens symbolizing contribution.  
- Patches may set unique quest types reflecting local priorities (gardening, mentorship, tech upkeep, etc.).

### 2. Patch Tokens
- Each Patch can mint **local tokens** representing hours, favors, or symbolic gratitude.  
- Tokens circulate within the Patch and may be exchanged with others via **Reciprocity Bridges**.  
- These are **expressive currencies**, designed for cultural and ecological feedback — not speculative trade.

### 3. The Ledger of Giving
- A transparent record of contributions, logged via the **Urban Alchemy Bot** or local systems.  
- Entries reflect **acts of service, creation, teaching, and repair**.  
- The ledger is both a memory and a mirror — it reveals the living pulse of the commons.

## IV. Meta-Mechanics

### XP & Role Progression
- Roles (Builder, Steward, Maker, Teacher) gain XP through participation.  
- XP influences privileges: initiating quests, starting collaborations, or proposing economic experiments.

### Milestone Rewards
- Collective goals (e.g., restoring a building, launching a festival) yield **communal celebrations** or special status tokens.  
- These act as **social glue**, emphasizing shared achievement over personal gain.

### Decay & Renewal
- Inactive tokens slowly dissolve, returning to the commons.  
- This ensures the **economy remains dynamic, regenerative, and alive.**

## V. Patch Autonomy & Experimentation

Each Patch may:
- Invent new currencies (e.g., “Sun Tokens,” “Trust Seeds”).  
- Tie rewards to ecological health or social vitality.  
- Integrate barter, gifting, or timebank models.  

All systems are **interoperable but not dependent** — Patches remain economic islands capable of sovereign innovation.

## VI. The Spirit of Playful Exchange

> *“Work becomes worship when play reclaims the heart of exchange.”*  

Gamification in Urban Alchemy’s economy invites participants to rediscover value as something **woven, not owned** —  
a living circulation of gratitude, creativity, and care.
