# Urban Alchemy Commons Model  
*Shared resources for regenerative, autonomous, and collaborative communities*

---

## Preamble

The commons is the **living fabric of Urban Alchemy**.  
It encompasses physical assets, digital infrastructure, knowledge, and cultural practices held in collective stewardship.  

This model is **not a rigid system** but a framework for sustaining shared resources while enabling local adaptation, autonomy, and regeneration.  

The commons thrives where **care, reciprocity, and responsibility converge**.

---

## I. Principles of the Commons

1. **Accessibility** — resources are available to those who participate in the commons in good faith.  
2. **Stewardship** — users are temporary custodians; preservation and regeneration are required.  
3. **Autonomy** — individual Patches may manage resources independently while optionally coordinating with the network.  
4. **Reciprocity** — contributions, whether labor, knowledge, or materials, are returned in some form to the network.  
5. **Transparency** — allocation, use, and impact of resources are visible to the community when feasible.  
6. **Sustainability** — growth and use are measured by renewal, not mere accumulation.

## II. Categories of Commons

1. **Physical Commons**  
   - Land parcels, buildings, tools, seeds, and other tangible assets.  
   - Stewardship includes maintenance, regeneration, and equitable access.  

2. **Digital Commons**  
   - Software, code repositories, documentation, and communication systems.  
   - Managed collaboratively; contributions and forks are tracked transparently.  

3. **Knowledge & Cultural Commons**  
   - Rituals, apprenticeships, codex texts, and community traditions.  
   - Preserved through archives, mentorship, and shared learning.  

4. **Network Commons**  
   - Resources maintained collectively for coordination between Patches: forums, data infrastructure, shared workshops.  

---

## III. Governance of Commons

- **Local Autonomy** — each Patch may manage the commons in its domain, establish usage norms, and adapt rules to local needs.  
- **Network Alignment (Optional)** — Patches may voluntarily coordinate with other Patches or the Central Board for cross-network resource projects.  
- **Audits & Stewardship Checks** — periodic or requested reviews ensure resources are maintained, regenerated, and used ethically.  

---

## IV. Contribution & Reciprocity

Participation in the commons is **both privilege and responsibility**:

- Contribute according to ability — labor, knowledge, resources, or cultural practices.  
- Receive according to need or engagement, balanced by sustainability and fairness.  
- Track contributions and outcomes using lightweight ledgers or shared documentation.  
- Encourage innovations that increase value for the community without diminishing autonomy.

---

## V. Autonomy and Expansion

Patches or individuals may:

- Establish new resource nodes.  
- Reorganize management, roles, or access rules at their discretion.  
- Withdraw from network coordination while still sustaining local commons.  
- Merge, share, or transfer resources voluntarily with others in the network.

Autonomy is the **default**, network coordination is **optional but encouraged** for mutual benefit.

---

## VI. Closing Statement

The commons is **both foundation and living organism**:  

> *“A shared resource is only as alive as those who care for it, and only as resilient as those who steward it without clinging.”*  

Urban Alchemy’s approach balances freedom and collaboration, allowing communities to **sustain, experiment, and regenerate** while maintaining ethical reciprocity.
