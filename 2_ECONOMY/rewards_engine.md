# Urban Alchemy Rewards Engine  
*Acknowledging contribution and cultivating reciprocity in the commons*

---

## Preamble

The Rewards Engine exists to **acknowledge effort, participation, and stewardship** without coercion.  
It is **not a currency** in the traditional sense, nor a system of hierarchical control.  
Instead, it functions as a **living ledger of value**, tracking contributions across labor, knowledge, cultural practices, and resource regeneration.  

The purpose is to **inspire engagement, cultivate reciprocity, and make visible the often-invisible work** that sustains the Urban Alchemy network.

## I. Principles

1. **Recognition over Compensation** — rewards acknowledge effort, not just outputs.  
2. **Autonomy over Obligation** — participants choose whether and how to engage with the system.  
3. **Transparency** — records of contributions and acknowledgments are visible to relevant stakeholders.  
4. **Flexibility** — the engine adapts to diverse types of contribution: material, cultural, digital, and relational.  
5. **Regenerative Incentive** — rewards favor behaviors that sustain and enrich the commons.

## II. Types of Contribution

1. **Physical Work** — building, maintenance, land stewardship, or tool-making.  
2. **Digital Work** — software development, documentation, archiving, or network facilitation.  
3. **Cultural Contribution** — rituals, teachings, apprenticeships, mentorship, or cultural innovation.  
4. **Community Support** — mediation, facilitation, audit participation, or other forms of relational labor.  

> Each contribution may be **tracked, acknowledged, and optionally rewarded**, respecting participant discretion and local Patch autonomy.

## III. Tracking and Ledger

- Contributions are logged in a **lightweight ledger**: digital, physical, or hybrid.  
- Each entry records:  
  - Contributor(s)  
  - Type of contribution  
  - Scope and impact  
  - Optional peer acknowledgment or comment  
- Ledgers may exist at **Patch level**, **network level**, or both, depending on participation preference.  

---

## IV. Reward Mechanisms

Rewards may be symbolic, experiential, or tangible:

- **Recognition Tokens** — badges, certificates, or symbols of acknowledgment.  
- **Access & Privileges** — invitations to events, workshops, or special projects.  
- **Resource Priority** — voluntary prioritization for shared resources or project participation.  
- **Cultural Honor** — acknowledgment in rituals, archives, or community storytelling.  

> Rewards are **non-extractive**: they motivate engagement without creating coercive competition or hierarchy.

---

## V. Autonomy and Optional Participation

- Patches and individuals **choose whether to engage** with the rewards system.  
- Participation may be **full, partial, or nonexistent**, without penalty.  
- Recognition is **voluntary and relational**, reinforcing trust and community cohesion.  
- Rewards can be **localized or shared network-wide**, depending on Patch preference.

## VI. Closing Statement

The Rewards Engine is a **living mirror of contribution and care**.  
It honors those who sustain the commons while remaining flexible, regenerative, and autonomous:  

> *“The work of the commons is a quiet symphony; the Rewards Engine simply helps us hear its notes.”*
