# Apprenticeship Model  
*Guided, experiential learning and skill transmission in the Patch network*

---

## Preamble

The apprenticeship model provides a **structured yet flexible framework** for knowledge transfer, relational skill-building, and hands-on experience.  
It integrates **mentorship, embodied practice, and peer learning**, emphasizing autonomy, reflection, and regenerative engagement.

---

## I. Principles

1. **Experiential Learning** — skills are acquired through practice, reflection, and application.  
2. **Relational Transmission** — mentorship occurs through direct interaction, guidance, and modeling.  
3. **Patch Autonomy** — each Patch defines roles, pathways, and pacing for apprenticeships.  
4. **Rotational Responsibility** — apprentices progress to mentorship, ensuring continual skill circulation.  
5. **Integration with Commons** — apprenticeships engage with ecological, cultural, and infrastructural work.

## II. Structure

### 1. Mentorship Roles
- **Mentor** — guides, models, and provides feedback.  
- **Apprentice** — observes, practices, and gradually assumes responsibilities.  
- **Peer Collaborators** — other participants support learning through cooperative projects.

### 2. Learning Pathways
- **Skill-Based Modules** — defined areas such as ecological restoration, ritual facilitation, or construction.  
- **Project-Based Learning** — hands-on tasks aligned with Patch goals and real-world impact.  
- **Reflective Practice** — journaling, discussion, or debriefing to reinforce lessons.

### 3. Progression
- Apprentices advance by demonstrating **competence, creativity, and relational maturity**.  
- Rotational mentoring ensures that knowledge circulates throughout the Patch.  
- Completion may culminate in facilitation or teaching responsibilities.

## III. Patch Autonomy & Adaptation

- Patches may **customize mentorship structures, skill areas, and evaluation criteria**.  
- Apprenticeship design balances **network guidance with local innovation**.  
- Autonomy allows adaptation to **environmental, cultural, or logistical conditions**.

---

## IV. Integration with Other Systems

- **Kivas & Resource Nodes** — serve as primary sites for hands-on learning and mentorship.  
- **Urban Alchemy Bot** — tracks apprenticeships, prompts reflection exercises, and schedules sessions.  
- **Rites and Games** — incorporated into experiential learning for relational and cultural skill-building.  
- **Building Reclamation & Ecological Projects** — provide real-world, project-based training opportunities.

## V. Closing Statement

The apprenticeship model is **a living, relational framework**:  

> *“Knowledge flows through practice, reflection, and guidance. Each apprentice becomes both learner and teacher, weaving skill, trust, and creativity into the Patch.”*  

It ensures **continuous skill circulation, cultural transmission, and regenerative capacity**, empowering both individuals and Patches to grow together.
