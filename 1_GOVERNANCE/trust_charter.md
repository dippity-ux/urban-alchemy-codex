# Urban Alchemy Trust Charter  
*Version 0.1 — Living Document*

---

## Preamble

Urban Alchemy is a living experiment in collective stewardship.  
It exists to cultivate reciprocal systems of care, creation, and governance — a civic alchemy blending ethics, ecology, and emergent design.  

This Trust Charter establishes the foundational agreements through which land, digital platforms, and cultural assets are held, tended, and evolved in common.  
It is not a contract but a covenant — a framework of belonging that guides how we wield power, distribute responsibility, and sustain the integrity of the commons.

---

## I. Purpose of the Trust

1. **To Hold the Commons** — ensuring that land, infrastructure, and digital systems remain collectively accessible, non-extractive, and in service to community regeneration.  
2. **To Steward Cultural Continuity** — protecting the integrity of Urban Alchemy’s ethos across generations, while allowing for local adaptation and organic evolution.  
3. **To Support Autonomous Patches** — granting each local Patch the right to self-organize, experiment, and evolve, within the shared ethical boundaries of the Charter.  
4. **To Embody Transparency and Reciprocity** — ensuring all decision-making, resource allocation, and leadership cycles are visible, accountable, and rooted in mutual trust.

---

## II. Structure of the Trust

The Trust operates as a **decentralized federation** composed of:

- **The Central Board** — a circle of stewards who safeguard the trust’s assets, maintain inter-Patch coherence, and update the codex.  
- **Patches** — semi-autonomous local communities, projects, or domains operating under this Charter. Each Patch may develop its own internal governance, guided by the Trust’s principles.  
- **Community Auditors** — appointed visitors who circulate between Patches to assess transparency, harmony, and adherence to the Charter, offering mentorship and mediation.  
- **The Commons Council** — an open deliberative forum (digital or in-person) for collective proposals, disputes, and amendments.

---

## III. Guiding Principles

1. **Reciprocity over Extraction** — All systems must return value to the whole.  
2. **Transparency over Secrecy** — Decisions affecting others must be visible.  
3. **Embodiment over Abstraction** — Policy must stay rooted in lived relationship.  
4. **Regeneration over Growth** — Sustainability is measured by renewal, not scale.  
5. **Plurality over Uniformity** — Divergent methods strengthen shared purpose.  
6. **Trust over Control** — Accountability flows from relationship, not coercion.

---

## IV. Stewardship and Accountability

Each steward of the Trust—whether landholder, developer, facilitator, or auditor—agrees to:

- Disclose conflicts of interest openly and immediately.  
- Uphold the collective code of ethics and facilitate its revision when outdated.  
- Participate in annual or seasonal **Accountability Audits**, where peers reflect back impacts, blind spots, and growth edges.  
- Rotate leadership roles regularly to prevent ossification and burnout.  
- Treat all commons assets (including data, land, and lore) as **temporary custodianship**, not ownership.

---

## V. Amendments and Evolution

The Charter is a living framework. Amendments may be proposed by any Patch or steward and must pass through a **triple consent process**:

1. Consent of the Central Board.  
2. Consent of a quorum of Patches (minimum 60%).  
3. Community affirmation via open council or digital vote.

Each revision will be logged transparently in `6_APPENDICES/version_history.md`, maintaining historical integrity of all previous versions.

---

## VI. Dissolution Clause

Should the Trust dissolve, all assets—physical, digital, or cultural—shall revert to **local commons trusts or allied regenerative entities**, ensuring that no private or corporate interest may claim surplus control or profit from the dissolution.

---

## VII. Closing Statement

Urban Alchemy is founded not on possession, but on **presence**.  
Each steward is both keeper and kept—by the living network that sustains all.  
The Trust is a sacred instrument for reciprocity, not dominance; a vessel for civic awakening, not mere organization.  

> *“That which is held in trust must also hold us in return.”*
