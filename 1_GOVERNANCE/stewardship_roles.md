# Urban Alchemy Stewardship Roles  
*Roles that sustain the network and empower autonomous Patches*

---

## Preamble

Stewardship in Urban Alchemy is both **practical and sacred**.  
It is the responsibility to maintain, transmit, and evolve the commons while enabling autonomy and experimentation.  

Roles exist at two levels:

1. **Central Network Roles** — support the cohesion, integrity, and evolution of the Urban Alchemy network.  
2. **Patch Roles** — optional, flexible roles that Patches define according to local needs, culture, and priorities.

---

## I. Central Network Roles

These roles maintain system-wide coherence and provide optional guidance to Patches:

### 1. Central Board Steward
- Maintains overarching governance, including adherence to the Trust Charter.  
- Approves network-level initiatives and collective proposals.  
- Serves as liaison between Patches and the Commons Council.  

### 2. Commons Council Coordinator
- Facilitates deliberation among Patches and stewards.  
- Organizes votes, proposals, and amendments.  
- Documents outcomes and ensures historical integrity.  

### 3. Community Auditor
- Circulates between Patches (upon request) to assess transparency, alignment, and resource integrity.  
- Provides mentorship and mediation.  
- Offers feedback to both local and central governance bodies.

---

## II. Patch Roles

Patches are empowered to define their own roles, with optional alignment to central guidance. Common roles include:

### 1. Patch Steward
- Coordinates local operations and community priorities.  
- Acts as liaison with the network **if the Patch chooses**.  

### 2. Cultural Custodian
- Facilitates rituals, apprenticeships, and local cultural practices.  
- Maintains the living ethos of Urban Alchemy within the Patch.  

### 3. Resource Coordinator
- Manages local assets: land, digital resources, or cultural artifacts.  
- Ensures sustainable use and renewal of resources.  

### 4. Scribe / Archivist
- Maintains records, documents experiments, and archives knowledge.  
- Supports historical continuity and potential network integration.  

> **Note:** Patches may create additional roles, merge roles, or operate without formal roles entirely, according to their autonomy.

---

## III. Optional Network Participation

Patches may choose to:

- Share insights, practices, or resources with other Patches or the Central Board.  
- Participate in cross-Patch mentorship or collaborative projects.  
- Request mediation or audit support from Community Auditors.  

Participation is **voluntary**; the autonomy of the Patch is paramount.

---

## IV. Principles of Stewardship

All stewards, whether central or local, are guided by:

1. **Autonomy** — respect for self-directed governance.  
2. **Transparency** — clarity of decisions and resource use.  
3. **Reciprocity** — contributing knowledge, care, or resources as able.  
4. **Integrity** — acting in alignment with the ethos of Urban Alchemy.  
5. **Flexibility** — adapting roles and responsibilities to evolving needs.

---

## V. Closing Statement

Stewardship is both a role and a practice — a living responsibility that balances **care for the commons** with **freedom for innovation**.  

> *“A steward is both keeper and witness — holding what is shared, honoring what is local, and nurturing what may yet emerge.”*
