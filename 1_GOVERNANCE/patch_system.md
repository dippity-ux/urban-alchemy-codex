# Urban Alchemy Patch System  
*Semi-autonomous nodes for localized stewardship*

---

## Preamble

Patches are the living cells of the Urban Alchemy network.  
Each Patch represents a **semi-autonomous community, project, or domain**, empowered to define its own scope, structure, and practices.  

Patches may operate as **islands**, experimenting independently, while optionally contributing to the broader network.  
They remain accountable primarily to their own community, and secondarily to the Trust Charter and Commons Council if they choose to participate in collective governance.  

---

## I. Purpose of Patches

1. **Localized Governance** — empower communities to self-organize, experiment, and define their own rules of stewardship.  
2. **Cultural Incubation** — serve as laboratories for rituals, apprenticeships, and community traditions.  
3. **Resource Stewardship** — maintain and regenerate physical, digital, and cultural commons within their domain.  
4. **Optional Network Contribution** — provide insights, feedback, or resources to the broader network at their discretion.  

---

## II. Structure and Autonomy

Each Patch is free to define its internal governance, roles, and operations. While alignment with the Trust Charter is encouraged, it is **not a requirement** for Patches to exist or expand.  

### Optional Internal Roles

- **Patch Steward** — coordinates local operations; liaison with the network if desired.  
- **Cultural Custodians** — facilitate rituals, apprenticeships, and local practices.  
- **Resource Coordinators** — manage local assets and infrastructure.  
- **Scribes / Archivists** — maintain knowledge and document learning.

Patches may combine, expand, or redefine roles at their own discretion.

---

## III. Formation and Recognition

A new Patch may choose to announce itself locally or to the network.  
Recognition by the Central Board or Commons Council is optional and **only necessary if the Patch wishes to participate in networked projects or governance**.  

Once established, a Patch operates according to its own chosen governance and scope.

---

## IV. Responsibilities of Patches

- **Internal Transparency** — maintain clarity of decisions and resource use for their community.  
- **Reciprocity** — contribute to the network only if the Patch chooses.  
- **Autonomous Evolution** — expand, restructure, or redefine roles at any time.  
- **Documentation** — keep internal records for continuity, if desired.

---

## V. Inter-Patch Interaction

Patches may interact with each other, or not — there is no requirement:  

- Optional sharing of best practices, resources, or cultural innovations.  
- Optional participation in cross-Patch mentorship and apprenticeship programs.  
- Optional involvement in collective projects or events.  
- Conflicts between autonomous Patches may be mediated if both parties request network assistance.

---

## VI. Evolution and Sunset

Patches are inherently **dynamic and independent**:

- **Self-Directed Evolution** — Patches may expand their scope, redefine roles, or change operations at will.  
- **Merger** — Patches may voluntarily merge with others.  
- **Sunset** — When a Patch chooses to dissolve, its assets, knowledge, and responsibilities may be redistributed according to its own directives or reverted to neighboring Patches.

---

## VII. Closing Statement

Patches are the **living edge** of Urban Alchemy: where philosophy, culture, and systems meet practice.  
They embody experimentation, accountability (to themselves), and local stewardship, while optionally connecting to the network.  

> *“Each Patch is a pulse — sometimes alone, sometimes in rhythm with others, always carrying the work forward.”*
