# Urban Alchemy Bot  
*Practical automation and coordination for networked and autonomous communities*

---

## Preamble

The Urban Alchemy Bot is **an operational tool** for the Urban Alchemy network.  
It exists to **automate routine tasks, manage data, and support group coordination**, allowing human stewards to focus on strategy, culture, and relationship-building.  

The bot is **functional, transparent, and configurable**, enabling Patches to maintain autonomy while benefiting from shared systems.

---

## I. Principles

1. **Assistive Functionality** — supports humans in running routines, managing resources, and tracking contributions.  
2. **Transparent Operation** — all actions are logged and visible to relevant participants.  
3. **Configurable Autonomy** — each Patch can enable or disable features to suit local needs.  
4. **Complementary to Governance** — integrates with stewardship roles, audits, rewards, and ledgers.  
5. **Secure and Consent-Driven** — handles sensitive data only with appropriate permissions.

## II. Core Tasks

### 1. Riddle & Event Management
- Posts daily or weekly challenges, prompts, or ritual cues to channels.  
- Tracks participation and engagement.  
- Supports ceremonial and educational activities in Patches.  

### 2. Resource & Contribution Tracking
- Logs contributions to the Rewards Engine and Reciprocity Ledger.  
- Monitors usage of shared resources and flags anomalies.  
- Generates summaries for stewards or facilitators.  

### 3. Audit & Governance Assistance
- Prepares reports for Patch-level or network-level audits.  
- Provides reminders for deadlines, stewardship check-ins, and review cycles.  
- Tracks resolution of action items identified in audits.  

### 4. Communication & Coordination
- Sends notifications for events, meetings, or workshops.  
- Manages role-based permissions for different groups within Patches.  
- Supports asynchronous collaboration between Patches and network-level bodies.  

### 5. Optional Integrations
- Interfaces with ledgers, rewards systems, and other digital infrastructure.  
- Supports data export for analysis, reflection, or archival purposes.  
- Enables lightweight cross-Patch coordination without centralizing control.

## III. Patch Autonomy

- Each Patch may **run an independent instance** of the bot or a shared network instance.  
- Features can be toggled according to local priorities.  
- Participation in network-wide functionality is **voluntary**, ensuring no Patch is coerced.  

---

## IV. Operational Guidelines

- The bot executes tasks **mechanically**, without judgment or decision-making authority.  
- Sensitive or private data is **never shared** without consent.  
- Audit and rewards logs are **transparent but non-punitive**, supporting reflection and learning.  
- Automation is **meant to lighten administrative load**, not replace human stewardship.

## V. Closing Statement

The Urban Alchemy Bot is a **practical steward**, translating human intention into organized, transparent action:  

> *“It posts, tracks, logs, and reminds — enabling humans to care, connect, and cultivate without being bogged down by the routine.”*  

By focusing on operational support, the bot reinforces both **autonomy and coherence** across Patches and the network.
