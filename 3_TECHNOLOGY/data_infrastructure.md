# Urban Alchemy Data Infrastructure  
*Secure, decentralized, and adaptable management of community data*

---

## Preamble

Data is the **digital backbone of Urban Alchemy**.  
It includes records of contributions, resource usage, governance decisions, and cultural artifacts.  
Our infrastructure prioritizes **autonomy, transparency, security, and interoperability**, ensuring Patches maintain control over their own data while enabling optional network-wide integration.

## I. Principles

1. **Patch Autonomy** — each Patch manages its own data storage and access policies.  
2. **Transparency** — non-sensitive data is accessible for reflection, audits, and coordination.  
3. **Security & Privacy** — sensitive data is encrypted, access-controlled, and handled with explicit consent.  
4. **Interoperability** — standardized formats allow cross-Patch sharing while maintaining independence.  
5. **Resilience** — data is backed up and replicated as appropriate to prevent loss and enable recovery.

## II. Data Categories

1. **Operational Data**  
   - Logs of contributions, resource allocation, and bot activity.  
   - Audit reports and governance decisions.  

2. **Cultural & Knowledge Data**  
   - Ritual prompts, apprenticeship records, and codex content.  
   - Archives of ceremonies, stories, and community artifacts.  

3. **Network Integration Data**  
   - Shared ledgers, cross-Patch coordination records, and optional aggregated statistics.  
   - Participation in network-wide events and communication threads.

---

## III. Architecture

- **Decentralized Storage** — each Patch may host its own databases or use approved cloud solutions.  
- **Standardized Formats** — JSON, markdown, and other open standards ensure compatibility.  
- **Versioning & Backups** — changes are logged, with historical records retained for reflection and audits.  
- **Access Control Layers** — role-based and Patch-specific permissions govern who can view or modify data.  
- **Optional Aggregation** — network-level dashboards or summaries draw selectively from Patch data with consent.  

---

## IV. Practices

1. **Data Logging** — all contributions, events, and resource usage should be logged systematically.  
2. **Regular Backups** — each Patch maintains its own backup schedule to ensure resilience.  
3. **Consent & Confidentiality** — private or sensitive entries are encrypted and access-limited.  
4. **Cross-Patch Sharing** — only when agreed upon, using standardized formats for interoperability.  
5. **Periodic Audits** — data integrity and accuracy are reviewed as part of Patch governance cycles.  

---

## V. Integration with Other Systems

- **Urban Alchemy Bot** — interfaces with Patch databases to post notifications, track contributions, and assist audits.  
- **Rewards Engine & Reciprocity Ledger** — data flows are recorded for optional transparency and reflection.  
- **Discord Systems** — data may inform channel activity, role assignments, and event logs.  
- **Future Integrations** — architecture supports optional extensions, including analytics, mapping, or external collaboration tools.

## VI. Closing Statement

Urban Alchemy’s data infrastructure is **both a foundation and a tool**:  

> *“Data is the thread weaving autonomy, reflection, and coordination together. Managed well, it strengthens the commons without controlling it.”*  

It ensures that Patches **retain control**, the network remains **transparent**, and cultural, operational, and relational data **supports growth, learning, and trust**.
