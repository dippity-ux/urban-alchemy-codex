# Resource Nodes  
*Shared ecological and material infrastructure for autonomous Patches*

---

## Preamble

Resource nodes are **centralized or distributed sites** where Patches manage **communal resources, regenerative systems, and ecological infrastructure**.  
They are designed to support **sustainable use, transparency, and Patch autonomy**, providing the backbone for practical, collective action.

---

## I. Principles

1. **Commons Orientation** — resources are managed for collective benefit rather than private gain.  
2. **Regenerative Design** — systems restore and enhance ecological health over time.  
3. **Patch Autonomy** — each Patch defines node scope, maintenance schedules, and access rules.  
4. **Transparency** — resource use, availability
