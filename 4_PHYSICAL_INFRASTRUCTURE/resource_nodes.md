# Resource Nodes  
*Communal sites for ecological, cultural, and material resources*

---

## Preamble

Resource nodes are **centralized or distributed sites within a Patch** that provide access to material, ecological, and cultural resources.  
They are designed to **support self-sufficiency, regeneration, and shared stewardship** while enabling autonomy and experimentation.

---

## I. Principles

1. **Regenerative Use** — resource management prioritizes sustainability, renewal, and ecological balance.  
2. **Commons Access** — resources are available to Patch members according to transparent guidelines.  
3. **Patch Autonomy** — each Patch defines rules, roles, and priorities for node management.  
4. **Safety & Maintenance** — all nodes include protocols for safe use, storage, and upkeep.  
5. **Cultural Integration** — nodes may include ceremonial, educational, or apprenticeship functions alongside material resources.

## II. Types of Resource Nodes

1. **Material Resource Nodes**  
   - Tools, building materials, communal equipment, seeds, and renewable energy assets.  
   - Tracking systems may integrate with Rewards Engine or bot-assisted logs.  

2. **Ecological Nodes**  
   - Water systems, gardens, orchards, forests, and regenerative agricultural sites.  
   - Designed to enhance biodiversity, soil health, and climate resilience.  

3. **Cultural & Knowledge Nodes**  
   - Libraries, archives, ceremonial artifacts, and digital knowledge repositories.  
   - Support education, apprenticeship, and intergenerational transmission of skills.  

4. **Hybrid Nodes**  
   - Multi-purpose sites integrating ecological restoration, material storage, and cultural activities.  
   - Flexible design accommodates evolving Patch needs and experimentation.

## III. Management & Stewardship

- **Stewardship Roles**  
  - Defined locally; stewards monitor access, maintenance, and ecological health.  
  - Rotational roles encourage shared responsibility and prevent concentration of control.  

- **Tracking & Reporting**  
  - Optional logging via the bot or ledgers to record usage, contributions, and regeneration cycles.  
  - Supports audits and network-level reflection while respecting autonomy.  

- **Maintenance Protocols**  
  - Regular checks, seasonal renewal, and safety inspections.  
  - Adaptive strategies to respond to ecological changes, demand, or resource depletion.

---

## IV. Patch Autonomy & Expansion

- Patches may create **new nodes, repurpose existing nodes, or retire nodes** according to local priorities.  
- Node rules, access schedules, and stewardship roles are **configurable**, allowing Patches to experiment and innovate.  
- Cross-Patch sharing is optional and guided by **mutual consent and regenerative alignment**.

---

## V. Integration with Other Systems

- **Urban Alchemy Bot** — logs contributions, facilitates notifications, and tracks usage metrics.  
- **Rewards Engine & Reciprocity Ledger** — optional integration to reflect contributions and shared responsibilities.  
- **Kivas & Ceremonial Spaces** — resource nodes may connect to learning and ritual sites, reinforcing cultural cohesion.  
- **Data Infrastructure** — nodes may generate ecological, cultural, and operational data for reflection and decision-making.

## VI. Closing Statement

Resource nodes are **living infrastructure**, blending ecology, culture, and community:  

> *“Nodes are both practical and sacred — places where care circulates, knowledge grows, and life is restored.”*  

They anchor Patches in regenerative practice, **enabling autonomy, experimentation, and shared stewardship** within the CRLT framework.
