# Urban Alchemy Collective Map  
*A living blueprint of Patches, nodes, cultural hubs, gateways, and guild regions*

---

## I. Map Overview

The Collective Map captures **all active Patches, resource nodes, cultural hubs, gateway nodes, and governance roles** within Urban Alchemy.  

It now incorporates **30 bioregions**, each representing ecological, cultural, and logistical characteristics, which combine to form **guild regions**. These guilds coordinate collaboration, mentorship, and shared resources across multiple Patches.

- **Guild regions** coordinate multiple bioregions for mentorship, ceremonial exchange, and resource sharing.  
- Example:  
  - Guild North: Bioregion 1 ↔ Bioregion 2 via Shuttle Hub A and Virtual Node X  
  - Patch A ↔ Patch C: Collaborative microquests and tool sharing

## IX. How to Use / Update

1. **Add or update bioregions and guilds** using the table format.  
2. **Add new Patches, resources, cultural nodes, or gateways** as they emerge.  
3. **Update roles and coordinators** to reflect current participation.  
4. **Document connections** between bioregions, guilds, and Patches for continuity.  

> The Collective Map is **living and decentralized**, reflecting the evolving ecosystem of Urban Alchemy.

## X. Closing

This map unites **bioregions, guilds, Patches, gateways, and cultural nodes** into a single living document. It is a reference, planning tool, and reflection of **how the Urban Alchemy network grows organically** across ecological, cultural, and logistical lines.
