# Urban Alchemy Collective Map  
*A living blueprint of Patches, nodes, cultural hubs, and gateway connections*

---

## I. Map Overview

The Collective Map captures **all active Patches, resource nodes, cultural hubs, gateway nodes, and governance roles** within Urban Alchemy.  

It is **dynamic and participatory** — each Patch may update its own entries, add new nodes, or expand scope. The map also includes **network-level connections**, showing how Patches collaborate or share resources.

---

## II. Patch Directory

| Patch Name | Location / Scope | Steward(s) | Key Resources | Cultural Nodes | Notes |
|------------|----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Example Patch | Downtown Commons | Alice, Bob | Community garden, Tool library | Meditation circle, Workshop space | Open to new apprentices |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

> Each Patch may define its own roles and expand its scope independently.

---

## III. Resource Nodes

| Resource Node | Type | Location | Access Rules | Steward(s) |
|---------------|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Tool Library | Tools & Equipment | Patch HQ | Shared via reservation | Alice |
| Seed Bank | Agricultural | Garden Hub | Open during community hours | Bob |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

> Nodes can be **physical, digital, or cultural**, and may be linked to multiple Patches.

---

## IV. Gateway Nodes

Gateway Nodes enable **peer-to-peer movement of people, resources, and information** between Patches and nodes. They are the circulatory system of Urban Alchemy.  

| Gateway Name | Type | Connects | Capacity | Notes |
|--------------|------|---------|---------|------|
| Shuttle Hub A | People & Materials | Patch A ↔ Patch B | 10 people / 200kg | Runs on demand or scheduled microquests |
| Virtual Node X | Digital Collaboration | All Patches | Unlimited | Facilitates online workshops, data sharing |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

> Gateway Nodes are **modular and expandable** — new nodes can be added as Patches grow or resources shift.

---

## V. Governance & Roles

| Role | Scope | Responsibilities | Patch Affiliation |
|------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Steward | Patch-level | Resource management, facilitation, local audits | Example Patch |
| Community Auditor | Network-level | Cross-Patch accountability and support | Rotating / network |
| Ritual Facilitator | Cultural | Lead group ceremonies, gamified challenges | Various Patches |
| Gateway Coordinator | Network-level | Manage and schedule gateway operations | Assigned per gateway |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## VI. Cultural & Ritual Nodes

| Node Name | Type | Location / Patch | Activities | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------------|-----------|------|
| Meditation Circle | Somatic / Ritual | Patch Garden | Guided meditation, Embodied practice | Open to all |
| Microquest Hub | Gamification | Discord / Local | Daily tasks, Clean-ups, Creative exercises | Linked to online system |
| Workshop Studio | Artistic | Patch HQ | Sculpture, Painting, Collaborative projects | Materials provided |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## VII. Network Connections

- Patches may form **alliances, mentorships, or shared resource agreements**.  
- Connections can be **local, regional, or virtual**.  
- Gateways provide **transport and flow** for people, materials, and cultural exchange.  
- Example:  
  - Patch A ↔ Patch B via Shuttle Hub A: Tool sharing and joint workshops  
  - Patch C ↔ Patch D via Virtual Node X: Mentorship and ceremonial exchange  

---

## VIII. How to Use / Update

1. **Add a new Patch, node, or gateway** by following the table format.  
2. **Update roles, resources, or cultural nodes** whenever changes occur.  
3. **Document network connections** to reflect collaborations or mentorships.  
4. **Use notes for optional context** like accessibility, capacity, or permissions.  

> This map is **living and decentralized** — each Patch is responsible for updating its own footprint while contributing to the shared network.

---

## IX. Closing

The Collective Map is a **shared vision of Urban Alchemy**, showing how each Patch, node, cultural practice, and gateway fits into the larger ecosystem.  
It is **both a planning tool and a reflection** of the network’s current state, designed to grow organically as the community evolves.
