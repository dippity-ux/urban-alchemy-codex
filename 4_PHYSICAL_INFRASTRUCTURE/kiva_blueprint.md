# Kiva Blueprint  
*Sacred subterranean architecture for ritual, learning, and community gathering*

---

## Preamble

The kiva is a **central ceremonial and communal space** within each CRLT Patch.  
Inspired by traditional subterranean structures, the kiva is **a container for ritual, teaching, reflection, and relational work**, balancing privacy with visibility, and autonomy with shared intention.

---

## I. Principles

1. **Sacred Geometry & Orientation** — circular or polygonal form, with entrances and features aligned for symbolic and functional purposes.  
2. **Inclusivity & Safety** — accessible design and clear boundaries for participants.  
3. **Multi-Functionality** — supports rituals, teaching, apprenticeships, planning, and ceremonial gatherings.  
4. **Connection to Land** — integrated with natural surroundings, supporting environmental awareness and sensory immersion.  
5. **Autonomy & Modularity** — each Patch may adapt dimensions, materials, and features to local needs while preserving core ceremonial functions.

## II. Structural Elements

- **Entrance & Vents**  
  - A sunken or external entry with ventilation shafts for airflow.  
  - Serves as a symbolic threshold between ordinary and sacred space.  

- **Central Fire / Hearth Area**  
  - Optional hearth for ceremonial fires or symbolic focal points.  
  - Safety measures and clear protocols must be observed.  

- **Seating & Platform Arrangement**  
  - Circular or radial benches or floor seating to encourage equality and visibility.  
  - Optional elevated platforms for facilitators, rituals, or storytelling.  

- **Storage & Artifact Spaces**  
  - Shelves or niches for ritual objects, ceremonial tools, and archival materials.  
  - Accessible without disrupting ongoing activities.  

- **Acoustic & Sensory Considerations**  
  - Design should amplify or moderate sound for chants, music, and speech.  
  - Lighting and natural materials encourage embodied, immersive experience.

## III. Ceremonial Functions

1. **Ritual Gatherings**  
   - Seasonal ceremonies, initiation rites, and group reflections.  
2. **Apprenticeship & Teaching**  
   - Space for skill-sharing, mentorship, and experiential learning.  
3. **Reflection & Meditation**  
   - Individual or small-group contemplative practices.  
4. **Council & Decision-Making**  
   - Facilitates egalitarian discussion, planning, and network coordination.

---

## IV. Patch Autonomy

- Patches may **customize layout, materials, and scale** according to local conditions.  
- Ritual protocols are **guided but flexible**, allowing innovation within core ceremonial intentions.  
- Kivas may connect with outdoor ceremonial nodes, gardens, or other sacred architecture to form **integrated cultural landscapes**.

---

## V. Maintenance & Stewardship

- Regular inspections, cleaning, and repairs preserve both **structural integrity and ceremonial sanctity**.  
- Stewardship responsibilities are shared among participants to cultivate care and relational responsibility.  
- Artifacts and ceremonial tools are **documented and stored** according to Patch-specific protocols.

## VI. Closing Statement

The kiva is **both architecture and ritual container**:  

> *“It is earth held, body held, intention held — a space where learning, ceremony, and community breathe together.”*  

Through careful design, stewardship, and ceremonial use, the kiva **anchors the Patch’s cultural, spiritual, and relational life**, providing a sacred locus for connection and growth.
