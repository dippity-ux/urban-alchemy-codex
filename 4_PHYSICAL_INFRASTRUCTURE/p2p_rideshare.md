# Peer-to-Peer Rideshare — Policy & Operations

> **File:** `p2p_rideshare.md`  
> **Purpose:** a practical, copy-paste-ready policy & operations guide for a peer-to-peer (P2P) rideshare / carpool / shuttle network used by our community (includes gateway-node peer shuttle guidance).  
> **Use:** paste into your repo, adapt local legal/insurance language, and attach required local forms where indicated.

## 1. Overview / Purpose
This document defines the purpose, scope, operating rules, safety requirements, onboarding steps, and incident procedures for a community-run peer-to-peer rideshare and shuttle system. It is intended to support safe, reliable movement of people and resources between community gateway nodes and within bioregions.

---

## 2. Scope
Applies to:
- All community riders, drivers, and facilitators using P2P rideshare services organized by the project.
- All trips that are arranged through the community platform, channels, or designated gateway-node coordinators.  
Does **not** replace: local law, municipal regulations, or individual vehicle insurance requirements.

---

## 3. Definitions
- **Driver / Operator:** the person providing transport using a personally owned vehicle.  
- **Rider / Passenger:** the person(s) receiving transport.  
- **Gateway Node:** an agreed community meeting point that acts as a hub for transfers and resource shuttles between bioregions.  
- **Trip Coordinator:** person who posts rides, manages matching, and records manifests.  
- **Manifest:** trip record (driver, riders, vehicle, time, route).  
- **P2P Service:** any arrangement where community members provide rides to other members (carpool, shuttle, one-off rides).

---

## 4. Core Principles
- **Safety first:** prioritize vehicle, driver, and passenger safety at all times.  
- **Transparency:** manifests and basic trip info must be recorded for every trip.  
- **Voluntary & Honor-based:** participation is voluntary; the system relies on mutual accountability.  
- **Local compliance:** drivers must follow all local laws and maintain required insurance.

---

## 5. Eligibility & Minimum Driver Requirements
Drivers must:
1. Hold a valid driver’s license appropriate for the vehicle type.  
2. Maintain a clean and safe vehicle: working seatbelts, tires, lights, and current inspection where required.  
3. Carry at least the minimum automobile liability insurance required in their jurisdiction. (Community organizers should advise drivers to check insurance coverage for carrying passengers for compensation or donations; commercial/for-hire gaps are common.)  
4. Complete the community onboarding (ID verification, brief orientation, and sign code of conduct).  
5. Consent to a background and driving-record check if the trip type or passenger profile requires heightened screening (e.g., minors, vulnerable participants)—the community should set the screening depth and frequency.

---

## 6. Vehicle Standards
- Vehicle must be roadworthy and legally registered.  
- Carry a basic safety kit (first aid, flashlight, phone charger).  
- Clean interior and ability to secure cargo where applicable.  
- Maximum passengers must not exceed the vehicle’s legal seating capacity.

---

## 7. Booking, Matching, & Manifests
- Trips should be posted in the designated channel / platform with: origin gateway node, destination, departure time, driver name & contact, vehicle description, number of seats, and any cost/donation requested.  
- A manifest (driver + rider names, phone or handle, pickup/drop times) must be recorded before departure and retained for X days (recommended 30 days) for safety and follow-up.  
- Gateway nodes: use standardized pickup/drop coordinates and scheduled shuttle windows to simplify logistics and safe transfers between nodes.

---

## 8. Payments, Donations & Compensation
- Decide locally whether trips are free, donation-based, cost-share, or paid.  
- If collecting money, be transparent about pricing and how funds are used (fuel, vehicle wear, platform fees).  
- Note: collecting fare or compensation can affect insurance/regulatory status — consult local rules. Treat compensation as a factor that may require commercial/for-hire insurance or additional permits.

---

## 9. Safety Protocols & On-Trip Conduct
- Seatbelts required for all passengers.  
- No impaired driving (zero tolerance for drugs/alcohol while operating).  
- Drivers must stop and refuse transport to any passenger exhibiting violent/unsafe behavior.  
- Keep phone use hands-free while driving.  
- For long trips, schedule driver rest windows and swap drivers when feasible.

---

## 10. Background Checks & Screening (recommended approach)
- Minimum: identity verification + a national criminal database/sex-offender check (as allowed by law) + Motor Vehicle Record (MVR).  
- For frequent drivers and those transporting vulnerable populations, adopt more frequent and deeper screenings.  
- Maintain confidentiality of sensitive results; only designated safety officers should view screening records.

---

## 11. Incident Reporting & Response
Immediately after any incident (accident, assault, theft, severe vehicle failure):

1. Ensure safety and medical care.  
2. Notify Trip Coordinator and community safety officer within 2 hours.  
3. Complete an Incident Report Form within 24 hours (include manifest, photos, witness statements).  

Community response may include driver suspension pending investigation, trip refunds, or referral to law enforcement.

---

## 12. Liability, Insurance & Disclaimers
- Drivers are responsible for complying with their insurance terms. Many personal policies exclude commercial use or fare-based transport; verify coverage before operating. Community organizers must inform participants that using the P2P system may carry additional liability risks.  
- Provide a clear waiver/assumption-of-risk statement for riders (see sample below). Waivers are not a substitute for proper insurance or compliance; obtain legal review for your jurisdiction.

---

## 13. Privacy & Data Handling
- Collect only necessary data (name, contact, trip manifest).  
- Store manifests and onboarding/ screening documents securely; limit access to admins/safety officers.  
- Define retention policy (e.g., retain manifests for 30–90 days; retain screening records per legal requirements).  
- Do not publish sensitive personal details in public channels.

---

## 14. Dispute Resolution & Enforcement
- Establish a small community review board (3 people) to hear disputes and appeals within 7 days.  
- Possible sanctions: warning, temporary suspension, permanent ban, or referral to authorities.  
- Keep case records and notify involved parties of outcomes.

---

## 15. Gateway Node — Operational Guidance
- Gateway nodes are fixed, well-lit, easily described meeting points (parking lot corner, community hall entrance, trailhead).  
- Nodes should have a posted schedule for shuttle windows (e.g., departures at 08:00, 12:00, 17:00).  
- Each node should have a volunteer Node Coordinator who:  
  - Maintains a printed/online trip board each shuttle window,  
  - Confirms manifests,  
  - Helps resolve last-mile needs,  
  - Escalates incidents to safety officers.  
- For resource shuttles (equipment, supplies), record cargo items on the manifest and secure cargo with straps/containers. Assign custody receipts when moving valuable items.

## 22. Notes on Legal & Insurance Risk
This document is a **policy template** and **not legal advice**.  
Local rules vary widely; collecting fares, running scheduled shuttles, or operating as a regular carrier can change the regulatory/insurance classification of an operator. Consult local transportation authorities and an attorney for liability and licensing questions.

---

## Quick Start Checklist (for launch)
1. Appoint: Project Lead, Safety Officer, 3 Node Coordinators.  
2. Publish: `manifest_template.csv` and `driver_onboarding_form.md`.  
3. Hold driver onboarding session & collect docs.  
4. Run a pilot week with one gateway node and two drivers; review incidents and feedback.  
5. Iterate policies and scale to additional nodes.
