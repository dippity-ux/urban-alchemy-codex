# Building Reclamation  
*Ethical, gamified, and regenerative approaches to revitalizing derelict structures*

---

## Preamble

Building reclamation is the **process of restoring abandoned or neglected structures** for communal use, ecological regeneration, and cultural enrichment.  
It balances **practical restoration, legal responsibility, and regenerative design** while encouraging community participation and learning.

---

## I. Principles

1. **Ethical Reclamation** — prioritize consent, legal compliance, and respect for prior ownership where applicable.  
2. **Regenerative Design** — restored buildings support ecological health, community needs, and cultural activity.  
3. **Gamification & Engagement** — processes are structured to encourage participation, skill-building, and playful problem-solving.  
4. **Patch Autonomy** — each Patch defines local reclamation goals, roles, and timelines.  
5. **Transparency & Documentation** — actions, decisions, and progress are logged for accountability and reflection.

## II. Reclamation Framework

### 1. Assessment & Mapping
- Survey the building and surrounding site.  
- Identify structural integrity, hazards, and resource potential.  
- Map potential uses: housing, tool libraries, gardens, ceremonial spaces.

### 2. Legal & Ethical Compliance
- Confirm property status, permits, and local regulations.  
- Engage stakeholders where possible to ensure ethical alignment.  
- Document all permissions and agreements.

### 3. Community Engagement
- Form a reclamation team with defined roles and rotational responsibilities.  
- Integrate apprenticeships and skill-sharing opportunities.  
- Use gamified challenges to engage participation and skill-building.

### 4. Restoration & Adaptation
- Stabilize and repair structural elements using **low-impact, sustainable methods**.  
- Repurpose materials and incorporate regenerative design principles.  
- Adapt spaces for **multi-functional community use**: storage, kivas, workshops, gardens, or cultural nodes.

### 5. Documentation & Reflection
- Maintain visual and textual records of progress.  
- Log lessons learned, innovative methods, and ecological outcomes.  
- Feed reflections into Patch knowledge nodes and data infrastructure.

## III. Patch Autonomy & Innovation

- Patches may **prioritize different reclamation goals** (e.g., cultural vs. ecological).  
- Experimentation with materials, techniques, and adaptive reuse is encouraged.  
- Network-level sharing of approaches is optional, enabling **knowledge diffusion without coercion**.

---

## IV. Integration with Other Systems

- **Resource Nodes** — reclaimed buildings may become nodes for tools, water, gardens, or archives.  
- **Urban Alchemy Bot** — tracks progress, posts updates, and coordinates team efforts.  
- **Data Infrastructure** — logs structural, ecological, and social metrics.  
- **Kivas & Ceremonial Spaces** — reclaimed buildings may host ritual, teaching, and community gatherings.

## V. Closing Statement

Building reclamation is **a regenerative act of care, creativity, and community**:  

> *“To reclaim a building is to restore both structure and possibility — creating space for life, learning, and the commons to flourish.”*  

Through ethical practice, patch-level autonomy, and regenerative design, abandoned structures become **living, cultural, and ecological assets** for CRLT Patches.
