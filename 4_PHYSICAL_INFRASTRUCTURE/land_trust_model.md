# Common Restoration Land Trust (CRLT)  
*Shared stewardship for regenerative land and community infrastructure*

---

## Preamble

The Common Restoration Land Trust (CRLT) is a **community-managed land framework** designed to preserve, restore, and steward land for regenerative human and ecological practices.  
It emphasizes **long-term sustainability, collective responsibility, and decentralized autonomy**, enabling Patches to develop and govern land while remaining accountable to the broader network of the trust.

---

## I. Principles

1. **Commons Stewardship** — land is held collectively for ecological restoration, cultural practices, and communal benefit.  
2. **Patch Autonomy** — Patches manage local projects, infrastructure, and resource allocation within trust guidelines.  
3. **Long-Term Preservation** — land use prioritizes regeneration and ecological resilience over short-term exploitation.  
4. **Transparency & Accountability** — decisions, projects, and audits are documented and accessible.  
5. **Inclusivity** — stewardship is open to invited participants, balancing safety, trust, and regenerative goals.

## II. Trust Structure

- **Central Board**  
  - Oversees trust-wide policies, legal frameworks, and network coordination.  
  - Maintains registry of Patches, auditors, and major decisions.  

- **Patches**  
  - Semi-autonomous local units that manage specific parcels of land.  
  - Responsible for projects, infrastructure, rituals, and local governance.  
  - May expand scope, redefine roles, or innovate within trust principles.  

- **Community Auditors**  
  - Rotate among Patches to assess ecological, cultural, and operational practices.  
  - Provide recommendations for improvement without enforcing mandates.  

---

## III. Land Stewardship Practices

1. **Ecological Restoration**  
   - Rewilding, soil regeneration, water management, and biodiversity enhancement.  
2. **Sustainable Infrastructure**  
   - Low-impact housing, communal facilities, tool libraries, and renewable energy.  
3. **Resource Nodes & Commons**  
   - Shared gardens, water systems, and community spaces maintained collectively.  
4. **Cultural & Ritual Spaces**  
   - Kivas, ceremonial areas, and learning spaces for rituals, apprenticeships, and community gatherings.  

---

## IV. Patch Autonomy and Expansion

- Patches may **adapt local governance**, create sub-Patches, or expand project scope.  
- Local decisions are made by stewards and participants, guided by CRLT principles.  
- Expansion of land use or infrastructure must **align with regenerative and ecological objectives**, but formal approval from the central board is optional unless legal compliance requires it.  

---

## V. Accountability & Reporting

- Patches submit **voluntary updates** to the central board and auditors.  
- Audits focus on **ecological health, commons maintenance, and community well-being**, rather than enforcing rigid rules.  
- Transparency and record-keeping ensure **trust integrity** across the network.

## VI. Closing Statement

The CRLT is both a **framework and a practice**:  

> *“Land is held in trust not as property, but as responsibility. Each Patch tends, restores, and expands the commons in harmony with life itself.”*  

It balances **local innovation, ecological stewardship, and network cohesion**, enabling Patches to flourish independently while remaining part of a regenerative commons.
